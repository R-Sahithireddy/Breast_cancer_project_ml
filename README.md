# Breast Cancer Prediction 

## Problem Statement:<br>
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist in the early detection of breast cancer based on features extracted from clinical data.

## Dataset Description: <br>
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available on Kaggle.
Each instance in the dataset is labeled as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

## Attributes:

ID: Unique identification number. <br>
Diagnosis (Target): Malignant (M) or Benign (B).<br>
Features (computed from a digitized image):<br>
Radius<br>
Texture<br>
Perimeter<br>
Area<br>
Smoothness<br>
Compactness<br>
Concavity<br>
Concave Points<br>
Symmetry<br>
Fractal Dimension<br>
